MQE0006.howToFix=The problem is in the format of the HL7 message being sent. Please contact your software vendor to fix this issue.
MQE0006.whyToFix=The HL7 standard requires all submitters to indicate what type of responses are wanted. Without this information the receiving system will not know what type of Acknowledgment message to send back.
MQE0014.howToFix=The problem is in the format of the HL7 message being sent. Please contact your software vendor to fix this issue. HL7 requires the submitting system to generate a unique value for this field and it was not generated.
MQE0014.whyToFix=The HL7 standard requires this field to be generated by the submitting system in order to aid in identifying this message uniquely from all messages sent by a submitter in a given day. This generated ID can be used to associate acknowledgements with the original request or to find previously submitted messages for manual review.
MQE0015.howToFix=The system creating or sending the HL7 message is not reporting the right date and time. The date and time is being reported in the future. Please check the sending system and ensure that it has the time set correctly. The sending system may send in any time zone, but the time must be set correctly for the time zone.
MQE0015.whyToFix=It is important to ensure that vaccinations are reported and recorded on the right date. Incorrect time settings can affect not only the contents of the message, but the recording of critical immunization data in other places. Ensuring that all systems involved in handling immunization data are set to the same time is critical to ensure correct communication of dates and times.

MQE0114.whyToFix=Adding a known patient alias can assist in patient matching and merging into the official vaccination record.
MQE0115.howToFix=The birth date is indicated as happening after this message was created. Please verify the birth date for this patient and the sequence of message creation and submission to the IIS in relation to this date of birth. The IIS does not expect to receive advanced notice of a patient's birth. There may also be a problem with the system clock that causes the message date to be set to an invalid past date, which would cause the birth date to appear to be reported in the future. (Please note that the sending system and the receiving IIS do not have to be in the same time zone, the message header date does include the time zone so that the IIS can correctly calculate the time in the IIS time zone. As long as the sending system has the time zone set correctly and the time setting correctly for the time zone the receiving IIS will can adjust the date and time to the IIS time zone.)
MQE0115.whyToFix=The IIS only records immunizations that have been given for patients that have already been born. The IIS does not record information for patients yet-to-be-born.
MQE0117.howToFix=The patient birth date was not understood. Please contact your software vendor and request that patient birth dates be encoded properly.
MQE0117.whyToFix=The IIS matches patients by birth date and uses it to calculate when vaccinations are due. It is critical that the correct birth date is always submitted with patient records.
MQE0119.howToFix=The patient birth date is underage. Please contact your software vendor and request that patient birth dates be encoded properly.
MQE0119.whyToFix=The IIS matches patients by birth date and uses it to calculate when vaccinations are due. It is critical that the correct birth date is always submitted with patient records.
MQE0120.howToFix=The patient is much older than expected. The assumption is the patient date-of-birth has been recorded incorrectly or this does not represent a real person. Please verify the patient's birth date is recorded correctly. If it is, and the patient was born in years expected for someone to still be alive, then please contact your software vendor to ensure that the date is being encoded properly in the message. If the patient is a test patient and you are sending this to a test IIS, then please update the test patient to indicate a clinically appropriate age and resubmit. If this is being sent to a production IIS interface then please take steps to ensure this data is not submitted to the IIS and, if it has been submitted, send a request to the IIS to remove this test data from the repository.
MQE0120.whyToFix=The patient birth date is needed to generate an accurate immunization evaluation and forecast, and to match patient records. Incorrect birthdates cause major problems for the quality of data in the IIS.
MQE0121.howToFix=The multiple birth indicator is not coded with a proper value. Please contact your software vendor to ensure that it is being placed in the message properly. This status should only be indicated (either yes or no) when the status is known, otherwise leave it blank.
MQE0121.whyToFix=Indicating to an IIS that a patient is part of a multiple birth can give a clue to not merge records that are very similar.
MQE0122.howToFix=The multiple birth indicator is not coded. Please verify in the medical record if the multiple status is recorded or contact your software vendor to ensure that it is being placed in the message. This status should only be indicated (either yes or no) when the status is known, otherwise leave it blank.
MQE0122.whyToFix=Indicating to an IIS that a patient is part of a multiple birth can give a clue to not merge records that are very similar.
MQE0123.howToFix=The message indicates that this patient is definitely not in a multiple birth, but also that the birth order is greater than 1. This is inconsistent. Please contact your software vendor and request that they ensure that the data in the message is consistent. It should indicate a birth order of 1, indicate the patient is part of a multiple birth, or not indicate the multiple birth status.
MQE0123.whyToFix=Indicating to an IIS that a patient is part of a multiple birth and the birth order can give a clue to not merge records that are very similar. But sending conflicting information could confuse the IIS and lead to unintended outcomes in matching.
MQE0125.howToFix=The patient has been flagged as being part of a multiple, birth but with no indication of the birth order. Please verify that the birth order is set in the medical record or contact your software vendor to code the birth order when it is set. Ideally, a medical record system should prompt the user to indicate the birth order when there is a multiple birth.
MQE0125.whyToFix=Indicating to an IIS that a patient is part of a multiple birth can give a clue to not merge records that are very similar. Birth order gives even more detail and could even be used to match the right records automatically.

MQE0220.howToFix=The patient submitter ID (or medical record number) was not valued. Please contact your software vendor and request that they populate all messages with the medical record number.
MQE0220.whyToFix=The patient submitter ID or medical record number is a unique id assigned to a patient by the submitting system. This id must not be reassigned to other patients althought it might be retired in favor of other codes when records are merged. The IIS needs this to track the identity of records from submitters.
MQE0221.howToFix=The effective date for the patient funding eligibility code is before the birth of the patient. Please verify the value in the medical record.

MQE0244.howToFix=The vaccine admin code is missing. Please review how vaccines are coded in your system and select a CVX or NDC code that represents the vaccination given.
MQE0244.whyToFix=Correctly understanding what type of vaccination was administered is critical for building a complete vaccination history. Clinical Decision Support Systems depend on having access to a complete and accurate vaccination history. Without this the recommendations for a patient will be incorrect.
MQE0245.howToFix=Please update the vaccination recorded as administered with a vaccination that is specific to what was given. If a specific one is selected, then verify the CVX code that is being reported to ensure it is the correct match for what is in the recorded vaccination history.
MQE0245.whyToFix=Non-specific vaccination codes are reserved for reporting historical vaccines where information about which specific vaccination was given may not be available. It is better to record something of the vaccination history rather than have that information missing. But these non-specific codes should not be used in reporting administered vaccines where the reporter should know and thus be able to record the specific vaccine given. Without this specific vaccine information, the patient record will be incomplete, lot decrementing may not work properly, and recommendations may not take into account vaccine specific recommendations.
MQE0246.howToFix=Please ask your system or vendor to not submit events that are not vaccines.
MQE0246.whyToFix=The current list of CVX codes contains concepts that, strictly speaking, are not vaccines. Some of these are accepted by immunization systems while others may not be. Some immunization systems may even be barred from receiving such information. Care should be taken to only submit this type of information to systems that are prepared and willing to recieve it.
MQE0247.howToFix=The submitted code could not be recognized as a usable code. Please review how vaccines are coded in your system and select a CVX or NDC code that better represents the vaccination given.

Clinical Decision Support Systems depend on having access to a complete and accurate vaccination history. Without this the recommendations for a patient will be incorrect.
MQE0248.howToFix=Please contact your vendor and request that they do not send an administered vaccination that indicates that no vaccine was administered.
MQE0248.whyToFix=There is a CVX code value that indicates that a vaccine was not administered. While this code exists it should not be sent in messages to indicate a vaccination was given as this would cause confusion to the receiving system.
MQE0249.howToFix=Please contact your vendor and request that they do not send an administered vaccination without knowing what type of vaccination was administered.
MQE0249.whyToFix=The type of vaccination administered must be indicated to record a vaccination. The sender should not report that an unknown vaccination was given. This cannot be added to an official vaccination history.
MQE0251.howToFix=Review the vaccination administration date and or lot expiration date to ensure the information is correct. If the patient was given expired vaccine, the dose should be repeated.
MQE0251.whyToFix=The administration date is used both to identify a unique vaccination event and to establish the event in the correct place on the vaccination history. The primary function of an immunization history is to provide specific information about when vaccinations were given so that clinical decisions can be made as to what vaccinations are due next and if the patient is properly protected from disease.
MQE0252.howToFix=The vaccination administration date is recorded as having occurred after the message was constructed. This could mean that vaccination administrations are being recorded and reported before they have actually occurred, or HL7 messaging system's clock is set incorrectly, or the recording system has it's clock set incorrectly, or the vaccination administration date was set incorrectly in the future and this problem was not corrected before resubmission. Please contact you system administrator or vendor to verify if any of these situations are occurring.

The primary function of an immunization history is to provide specific information about when vaccinations were given so that clinical decisions can be made as to what vaccinations are due next and if the patient is properly protected from disease. Also, it is important to only report immunization events that have already occurred. Immunization events that are scheduled or expected to occur should not be reported for inclusion on a patient's vaccination history until they have been properly completed.
MQE0253.howToFix=The patient has been marked as having been deceased as a certain date, and after that date a vaccination was administered. Vaccinations are not given to patients after they die, so either the patient is not deceased or the vaccination event was recorded improperly. Please review the patient's death status and vaccination event to ensure both are recorded properly.

MQE0255.howToFix=The vaccination administered date is recorded as having occurred before the patient was born. Vaccinations are not given until after birth so the problem is assumed to happen because either the birth date or the vaccination date has been incorrectly recorded. Please review both of these values and determine which is incorrect.

MQE0262.howToFix=Most systems and all registries require that the full vaccination administration date be entered, but in some cases only the month and year are known. (Especially when transcribing data from old paper shot records.) In these cases, some operators may decide to enter the information but select a day of the month such as the first, fifteenth, or last day. Vaccinations can be given on any of these dates, but high levels of reporting administration on these dates of the month may indicate that this practice is happening. Please consult your registry on best practices for recording and reporting vaccinations that are known to be given but where you do not have the full date.
MQE0262.whyToFix=The administration date is used both to identify a unique vaccination event and to establish the event in the correct place on the vaccination history. The primary function of an immunization history is to provide specific information about when vaccinations were given so that clinical decisions can be made as to what vaccinations are due next and if the patient is properly protected from disease. Registries that combine data from multiple sources can struggle to properly match vaccinations that have different dates, and incorrect dates might lead to incorrect recommendations for next vaccinations due.

MQE0268.howToFix=The administered vaccination is indicated as being a foreign vaccine, one that is not normally administered in the US. Please review the vaccination codes you are sending with this vaccination and ensure that the information is being recorded correctly. Normally the IIS would not expect a foreign vaccine to be reported as administered in the US.
MQE0268.whyToFix=Correctly understanding what type of vaccination was administered is critical for building a complete vaccination history. Clinical Decision Support Systems depend on having access to a complete and accurate vaccination history. Without this the recommendations for a patient will be incorrect.
MQE0270.howToFix=The amount of vaccination administered is set to zero, which indicates that no vaccination was given. If this is the case then no immunization should have been reported. If the vaccination was properly and completely administered, but the amount was not known then it should be reported without indicating the amount. If the vaccination was not properly given then it should either not be reported, or if it was previously reported then a delete should be sent to remove the record. Please contact your vendor and request that immunizations not be reported with zero amount of vaccination.
MQE0270.whyToFix=While in most cases the amount of vaccination administered is known and can be assumed based on the type of vaccination given, there are some cases where the amount of vaccination given can vary between adult and child doses. Indicating the right dose amount can help in these situations and can also help to build a complete and proper vaccination history. Submitting a zero amount of vaccination given is confusing and may lead to the registry not understanding correctly what really happened.
MQE0271.howToFix=The amount of vaccination given was not indicated. Please ensure that the amount of vaccination given is recorded.

MQE0565.howToFix=There is nothing to fix if the patient was born on the fifteenth day of the month.
MQE0565.whyToFix=Sometimes when the exact patient date of birth is not known the fifteenth day of the month is chosen. It is important to use the correct date of birth, both for matching purposes and determining the right time for vaccinations.
MQE0566.howToFix=There is nothing to fix if the patient was born on the first day of the month.
MQE0566.whyToFix=Sometimes when the exact patient date of birth is not known the first day of the month is chosen. It is important to use the correct date of birth, both for matching purposes and determining the right time for vaccinations.
MQE0567.howToFix=This does not necessarily indicate there is a problem to fix, but sometimes patients are registered that have no birth date. This can happen when a birth date is not received or the patient comes from a country or culture where exact birth dates are not recorded. In these cases the birth date might be set to the last day of a given month. This check is done to verify the frequency, which if too high might indicate this is being done.
MQE0567.whyToFix=The IIS matches patients by birth date and uses it to calculate when vaccinations are due. It is critical that the correct birth date is always submitted with patient records.
MQE0568.howToFix=Review the patient record to ensure duplicate vaccines have not been recorded.
MQE0568.whyToFix=Accurate patient data helps keep patients vaccinated on time, avoiding under- and over-immunization.
MQE0569.howToFix=The administered vaccination was recorded in the recording system soon after it was actually administered. This is good practice and should be continued for all administered vaccinations.
MQE0569.whyToFix=Prompt reporting of immunizations allows for maintenance of a complete vaccination history that can serve the patient as they go to different care settings. Ideally, vaccinations should be reported the same day they are given, or at least within the next business day. It is not uncommon for patients to go immediately to other locations to receive additional immunizations and that clinician will need to see a full and up-to-date record.
MQE0570.howToFix=The administered vaccination was recorded in the recording system long after it was actually administered. There is nothing that can be fixed now for this record, but for future vaccinations it is ideal to record and report the administration as soon as possible.
